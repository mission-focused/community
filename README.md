# Community

Welcome! This is the source for the [Mission Focused community blog](https://missionfocused.dev)

The goal of this is to provide a vendor-neutral space to collaborate or discuss advancements or needs of the mission. 

Discussing Open Source solutions is encouraged - no product pitches please. 

## Purpose

I (@brandtkeller) wanted to see whether there was any interest in lowering the barrier to entry for spreading use-cases and experiences in software development and delivery across those who serve a **mission**. Typically Public Sector, but not always, I believe there is an underrepresented voice in technology for those who build solutions to serve a greater purpose. From access to critical services or infrastructure, to education, to National Security.  

## Suggest a new topic

If you'd like to suggest a topic we recommend the following:

### Short-form Article

If the article is short and meets the review criteria - please submit this as a Pull Request from a fork.

These are typically concise and straight-forward, invoke conversation, or is meant to be a catalyst for changing a process that does not operate efficiently today.

### Long-form Collaboration

These articles typically require more discussion and may have implications for production and review. 

Or perhaps you are looking to enlist help in collaborative authoring from others on an idea that has no concrete content as of yet. 

These would be best suited with an issue in this [repository](https://github.com/mission-focused/community).
